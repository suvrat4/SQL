# Set Operators:

## Introduction:
* SQL set operators allows combine results from two or more component queries into a single result.
* SQL set operators containing these set operators are referred as compound queries.
* And each SELECT statement in a compound query is referred to as a component query.
* Two SELECTs can be combined into a compound query by a set operation only if they satisfy the following two conditions.
          * The result sets of both the queries must have same number of columns.
          * The data type of each column in the second result set must match the data type of its corresponding column in the first result set.
